Welcome to the ZeroTier Edge

The Edge runs on a Linux image based on Alpine Linux, but the
"apk" package manager is not enabled. The base image is managed by
our update process.

A number of network diagnostic tools are available here including:

  ip, ifconfig, traceroute, tcptraceroute, tcpdump, nmap,
  ping, socat, nc, iptraf-ng, iperf3, iw, iwlist, arpwatch,
  arp-fingerprint, arp-scan, hping3, dnstracer, masscan,
  p0f, stunnel, drill, arping

The "sudo" command has been configured to allow these. It may
technically be possible to escape "sudo" into a root shell,
but we discourage this since changes elsewhere will be lost in
the update process or may prevent updates from working properly.
